Preprocessing
=============

A set of command line tools for data preprocessing steps is described in this section, 
which include data format conversion, data correction and brain extraction.

.. _DICOM_to_NIFTI:

DICOM to NIFTI Conversion
-------------------------

For saving space of data store, the nii.gz format was used throughout the 
whole pipeline. Firstly, we use the 
dcm2nii (by Chris Rorden, https://www.nitrc.org/projects/dcm2nii) to convert the 
data into a single 3/4D .nii.gz volume-series file, plus bval and bvec files. 
The format of bval file is ::

 0 1500 1500 ... 1500

and the format of bvec file is ::

 0  0.99944484233856   0.00215385644697   0.00269041745923 ...
 0  -0.0053533311002   0.99836695194244   0.60518479347229 ...
 0  0.03288444131613  -0.05708565562963   -0.79608047008514 ...

where the 0 in the first column indicates the b0 images in the scan and 
certainly the software also supports multi-b0 images. 
Since the DICOM formats from different scanner might be different, 
this function is not always able to successfully extract the bvec/bval files. 
If you encounter such a problem, please get back to us <link> and 
give the link of your data if it has big size beyond the email capability.

.. _Eddy_Current_Correction:

Data correction
--------------------------

During the MRI scanning, many factors can cause distortions and misalignment. 
The diffusion weighted imaging (DWI) volume series (as a 4D zipped NIFTI file) 
are then corrected for the distortions induced by off-resonance field and the 
misalignment caused by subject motion. The off-resonance effects are usually 
caused by the eddy currents of switching the diffusion encoding gradients and 
the susceptibility distribution of the imaged subjects, resulting in the deterioration 
of images due to blurring, spatial distortion, local signal artifacts, etc. The 
motion effects also cause image blurring and geometric misalignment (Andersson 
and Sotiropoulos, 2016; Bernstein et al., 2004). To correct the distortions 
induced by susceptibility and eddy current when the data is acquired with different 
phase-encode parameters, we include the correction mechanism using different 
phase-encode information. We he functions of :code:'topup', :code:'applytopup', :code:'eddy' and :code:'eddy_combine' 
from FSL (Andersson and Sotiropoulos, 2016; Andersson et al., 2003; Smith et al., 2004), 
compiled them on both Linux and Windows platforms, and packed the executable files 
into the latest version of DiffusionKit. The detailed usage information, please 
refer to the website of FSL (http://fsl.fmrib.ox.ac.uk/fsl/fslwiki/).

Unfortunately, most clinical acquisitions do not currently meet the requirement 
(two or more acquisitions where the parameters are different so that the mapping 
fields for distortion correction are different.) of topup. To handle this issue, 
we implemented a function called bneddy to correct eddy-current induced distortion 
and head movements efficiently. bneddy applies rigid and affine registrations to 
amend the distortions and misalignment.


.. code-block:: bash

 $ ./bneddy -h

Skull Stripping (Brain Extraction)
----------------------------------

This module is to strip the brain skull and extract the brain tissue, including 
gray matter, white matter, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and cerebellum. It 
largely benefits the following processing and analysis, offering better 
registration/alignment results and reducing computational time by excluding 
non-brain tissue. Therefore, although this step is not compulsory, we strongly 
recommend enforcing it. This module is adapted from the FSL/BET functions 
(http://fsl.fmrib.ox.ac.uk/fsl/fslwiki/BET) for its excellent efficacy and efficiency.

.. _Reconstruction:

Reconstruction of the diffusion model
=====================================

The reconstruction for diffusion model within pixels is one of the key topics 
in diffusion MRI research and it is also one of key modules of the software.
At the current stage, we have integrated three modeling methods: one is 
the traditional Gaussian model (commonly known as DTI, diffusion tensor 
imaging), and the other two are for high angular resolution diffusion imaging 
(HARDI). For more detailed information please refer to our review paper 
`[11] <reference.html#id11>`_ and `[13] <reference.html#id13>`_ .

.. _DTI_Reconstruction:

DTI Reconstruction
------------------

The classical diffusion gradient sequence used in dMRI is the pulsed gradient 
spin-echo (PGSE) sequence proposed by Stejskal and Tanner. This sequence 
has 90o and 180o gradient pulses with duration time δ and separation time Δ. 
To eliminate the dependence of spin density, we need at least two measurements 
of diffusion weighted imaging (DWI) signals, i.e. S(b) with the diffusion 
weighting factor b in Eq. (1) introduced by Le Bihan etc, and S(0) with 
b = 0 which is the baseline signal without any gradient. 

.. raw:: html

 $$ \begin{equation}\tag{1}
 b=\gamma^2 \delta^2 (\Delta-\frac{\delta}{3}){||\bf{G}||}^2
 \end{equation} $$

In the b-value in Eq. (1), $\\gamma$ is the proton gyromagnetic ratio, 
$\\bf{G}=||\\bf{G}||\\bf{u}$ is the diffusion sensitizing gradient pulse 
with norm $||{\\bf G}||$ and direction ${\\bf u}$. $\\tau=\\Delta-\\frac{1}{3}\\delta$ 
is normally used to describe the effective diffusion time. Using the PGSE 
sequence with S(b), the diffusion weighted signal attenuation E(b) is given 
by Stejskal-Tanner equation,

.. raw:: html

 $$ \begin{equation}\tag{2}
 E(b)=\frac{S({b})}{S(0)}=\exp(-{b}D)
 \end{equation} $$

where D is known as the apparent diffusion coefﬁcient (ADC) which reﬂects 
the property of surrounding tissues. Note that in general ADC D is also 
dependent on G in a complex way. However, free diffusion in DTI assumes 
D is only dependent on the direction of G, i.e. . The early works in dMRI 
reported that ADC D is dependent on gradient direction u and used two or 
three DWI images in different directions to detect the properties of tissues.
Then Basser et al. introduced diffusion tensor `[12] <reference.html#id12>`_ to 
represent ADC as $D(\\bf{u}) = {\\bf u^{T}}{\\bf D}\\bf{u}$, where ${\\bf D}$ 
is called as the diffusion tensor, which is a 3 × 3 symmetric positive deﬁ
nite matrix independent of u. This method is called as diffusion tensor 
imaging (DTI) and is the most common method nowadays in dMRI technique. In 
DTI, the signal E(b) is represented as 

.. raw:: html

 $$ \begin{equation}\tag{3}
 E(b)=\exp(-b{\bf u^{T}}{\bf D}\bf{u})
 \end{equation} $$

   :alt: Tensor field and the scalar maps
   :align: center

   Figure 4. Tensor field and the scalar maps estimated from a monkey data with b = 1500s/mm2.

The diffusion tensor D can be estimated from measured diffusion signal samples 
through a simple least square method or weighted least square 
method `[12] <reference.html#id12>`_, or more complex methods that consider 
positive deﬁnite constraint or Rician noise. If single b-value is used, the 
optimal b-value for tensor estimation was reported to in the range of (0.7~1.5)x$10^{3} s/mm^2$, 
and normally about twenty DWI images are used in DTI in clinical study. ome 
useful indices can be obtained from tensor D. The most important three indices 
are fractional anisotropy (FA), mean diffusivity (MD) and relative anisotropy (RA) deﬁned as 

.. raw:: html

 $$ \begin{equation}\tag{4}
 {\rm{FA}}=\frac{\sqrt{3}||{\rm{D}}-\frac{1}{3} \rm{trace} ({\rm{D}}) I ||}{\sqrt{2}||{\rm{D}}||}
 =\sqrt{\frac{3}{2}}\sqrt{\frac{(\lambda_1-\bar{\lambda})^2+(\lambda_2-\bar{\lambda})^2+(\lambda_3-\bar{ \lambda})^2}{\lambda_{1}^{2}+\lambda_{2}^{2}+\lambda_{3}^{2}}}
 \end{equation} $$

.. raw:: html
 
 $$ \begin{equation}\tag{5}
 {\rm{MD}}=\bar{\lambda}=\frac{1}{3} \rm{trace} ({\rm{D}})=\frac{\lambda_1+\lambda_2+\lambda_3}{3}
 \end{equation} $$ 

.. raw:: html
 
 $$ \begin{equation}\tag{6}
 {\rm{RA}}=\sqrt{\frac{(\lambda_1-\bar{\lambda})^2+(\lambda_2-\bar{\lambda})^2+(\lambda_3-\bar{\lambda})^2}{3\bar{\lambda}}}
 \end{equation} $$ 

where,  are the three eigenvalues of D and  is the mean eigenvalue. MD and FA have been used in many clinical applications. For example, MD is known to be useful in stroke study. For more detailed information please refer to our review paper `[13] <reference.html#id13>`_.

.. _SPFI_Reconstruction:

SPFI Reconstruction
-------------------

It was proposed that the SPFI method has more powerful capability to identify 
the tangling fibers `[8] <reference.html#id8>`_. In SPFI `[8] <reference.html#id8>`_, 
the diffusion signal  is represented by spherical polar Fourier (SPF) basis functions in Eq. 7. 

.. raw:: html

 $$\begin{equation} \tag{7}
 E(q)=\sum_{n=0}^{N}\sum_{l=0}^{L}\sum_{m=-l}^{l} a_{lmn}R_{n}(||q||)Y_{l}^{m}(u)
 \end{equation}$$

The SPF basis denoted by $R_{n}(||q||)Y_{l}^{m}(u)$ is a 3D orthonormal basis with 
spherical harmonics in the spherical portion and the Gaussian-Laguerre function in 
the radial portion. Furthermore, Cheng and his colleagues proposed 
a uniform analytical solution to transform the coefficients $a_{lmn}$ of $E(q)$ 
to the coefficients $c_{lm}^{\\Phi_w}$ of ODF (orientation distribution function) 
represented by the spherical harmonics basis, as in Eq. 8. 

.. raw:: html

 $$\begin{equation} \tag{8}
 \Phi_w(r)=\sum_{l=0}^{L}\sum_{m=-l}^{l}c_{lm}^{\Phi_w}Y_{l}^{m}(r)
 \end{equation}$$

It is a model-free, regularized, fast and robust reconstruction method 
which can be performed with single-shell or multiple-shell HARDI data to 
estimate the ODF proposed by Wedeen et al. `[14] <reference.html#id14>`_. 
The implementation of analytical SPFI includes two independent steps. 
The first estimates the coefficients of $E(q)$ with least squares, 
and the second transforms the coefficients of $E(q)$ to the coefficients of ODF.

.. _CSD_Reconstruction:

CSD Reconstruction
------------------

The CSD method was proposed by Tournier et al. `[9] <reference.html#id9>`_, which expresses the diffusion signal as in Eq. 9,

.. raw:: html

 $$\begin{equation} \tag{9}
 S(\theta,\Phi) = F(\theta,\Phi)\otimes R(\theta)
 \end{equation}$$

where $F(\\theta,\\Phi)$ is called the fiber orientation density function (fODF), 
which needs to be estimated, and $R(\\theta)$ is the response function, 
which is the typical signal generated from one fiber. 
The response function can be directly estimated from 
diffusion weighted image (DWI) data by measuring the diffusion profile 
in the voxels with the highest fractional anisotropy values, 
indicating that a single coherently oriented fiber population 
is contained in these voxels. When the response function is obtained, 
we can utilize the deconvolution of $R(\\theta)$ from $F(\\theta,\\Phi)$ 
to estimate the fiber ODF. The computation of the fiber ODF was carried out using the software 
MRtrix (J-D Tournier, Brain Research Institute, Melbourne, Australia, 
http://www.brain.org.au/software/). 
We thank Dr. Jacques-Donald Tournier for sharing MATLAB code of the CSD method, 
which inspired an efficient C/C++ implementation.

.. _Fiber_Tracking:

Fiber tracking and attributes extraction
========================================

Fiber tracking is a critical way to construct the anatomical connectivity 
matrix. For the tracking based on tensors from DTI, an intuitive way is 
to link the neighboring voxels following their main directions (e.g. V1 
in the eigenvector of the DTI) given a set of some stop criteria, such as 
maximum bending angle of the curve and minimum FA value, which is to ensure 
the target voxel is indeed white matter microstructure. This is the so called 
deterministic streamline tractography `[15] <reference.html#id15>`_, as illustrated in Figure 5.

    -o                   Output Fibers Filename (.trk file).

The tracking module in the software for HARDI estimation is similar to the 
streamline method as described above. It should be kept in mind that, for 
HARDI estimation, usually there are more than one main direction (which 
is what we desired since it possibly identifies tangling fibers), so we 
should consider these kissing/branching cases. Meanwhile, since there is 
no explicit dominant directions for each voxel, searching algorithm should 
be applied to locate the main directions. The searching should run for each 
voxel, so it is not as fast as the traditional DTI tracking.

Visualization for various images
================================

The software provides a variety of entries for visualizing different data 
types, including 3D/4D image, Tensor/ODF/FOD image and white mater fibers.
The views of different data could be superimposed for a precise anatomical 
localization. It should be noted that, if one uses the GUI, these view functions 
could be called in each processing steps for inspecting the results.

Several other useful tools
==========================

Image registration
------------------

This module is implemented by NiftyReg, which is an open-source software 
for efficient medical image registration. It has been mainly developed by 
members of the Translational Imaging Group with the Centre for Medical 
Image Computing at University College London, UK `[10] <reference.html#id10>`_. 
In our software, the registration module is customized to auto-configure 
the parameter settings for different image modalities, e.g., two DWI 
images (for eddy current correction in current version), standard space and T1 
space (for mapping ROIs to the individual space), DWI space and 
standard space (for statistical comparisons across subjects). This 
module contains several commands :code:`reg_aladin` is the command for 
rigid and affine registration which is based on a block-matching approach and 
a Trimmed Least Square (TLS) scheme `[18] <reference.html#id18>`_ 
`[19] <reference.html#id19>`_. :code:`reg_f3d` is the command to perform 
non-linear registration which is based on the Free-From Deformation presented 
by Rueckert et al. `[20] <reference.html#id20>`_. :code:`reg_resample` is 
been embedded in the package. It uses the output of :code:`reg_aladin` and 
:code:`reg_f3d` to apply transformation, generate deformation fields or 
Jacobian map images for example.

Image calculation and ROI generation
------------------------------------

The module :code:`bncalc` provides simple image calculations, 
such as add/minus/multiply/divide operations. 
Meanwhile, it can also generate user-defined ROIs given 
the origin and radius in a user-specified image space.

.. code-block:: bash

 $ bncalc -h
 DiffusionKit (v1.2), http://diffusion.brainnetome.org/. 
 This funciton provide basic process for the input data (NIFTI/Analyze format)
 Usage of bncalc:
    -i       image         The original file you want to manage.
    -add     image/value   Add to the data from the last step.
    -sub     image/value   Subtract data from the last step.
    -mul     image/value   Multiply the data from the last step.
    -div     image/value   Divide the data from the last step.
    -roi     x,y,z,r       Generate a ROI centered at [x,y,z](MNI mm) with radius r,
                           in the input data space.
    -mask    image         Mask the data from last step by this input one. 
                           If this input is a binary, then it is the same as 
                           -mul, otherwise it keep the voxels from the last step 
                           when the new input is nonzero.
    -bin     value         set 1 if >value, otherwise 0. 
    -uthr    value         Set voxel=0 when it>=value. 
    -dthr    value         Set voxel=0 when it<=value. 
    -o       image         output a NIFTI (.nii.gz) file

Fiber manipulation
------------------

After obtaining a large bundle of white matter fibers, you may want to prune 
the fibers that go through specified locations (ROIs). Here, we provide 
several tools to manipulate the fiber bundles. :code:`bnfiber_prune`, to 
split fiber bundles based on given ROIs.
